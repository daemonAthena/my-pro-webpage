# Website Plan

## Site Goals
To present my professional information to any prospective visitor. This includes research, projects, programming/tools, CV's, and academic resources which I want to plug that aid in my research. Besides content, it is my goal to make my website aesthetically pleasing which I plan to accomplish with CSS (and possibly JavaScript if I have time).

## Site-map
For my site map, I plan to have 3 tabs. Projects, Research, and CV. I'd also like to include a map of the mediterranean that I model in GIS with ancient cities relevant to my research in ancient Christianity and possibly a timeline with selectable elements.

## Design Justifications
Most of the design decisions I've made are kind of self explanatory.

I think maps are a great tool for getting people thinking about and interacting with history so I aspire to have one.

## Modeling
The two websites I'd like to model my professional website after are: 
* The professional website of my friend who is also a math professor, Luna Elliot: https://le27.github.io/L-Elliott/. I'd like to copy the structure she uses to organize her publications and CVs.
* A site that was given in the example sites of the first reading assignment preserving a primary source map of Lyon during the renaissance: http://www.renlyon.org/. I'd like to take inspiration from the dropdown menu allowing you to change between different map views and included project documentation for the map I plan to host on this website.
